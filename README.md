| :------------- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| User keys in three equal numbers      |  Three equal numbers    | That is an equilateral triangle.|
| User keys in two equal numbers and one different.| Two similar numbers and one different|That is an isosceles triangle|
| User keys in three different numbers  | Three different numbers | That is a scalene triangle |
| User keys in two numbers that add up to the third or is equal to the third | Abnormal entries | That is not a triangle|


## Specs
To get an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
To get an isosceles triangle, two sides must be equal.
To get a scalene triangle, none of the sides should be equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle should be greater than the third side.
If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed.
